A target is the device where the stream will be played on.
**Where the scraping is run has nothing to do with the target**, only where the stream is finally played in the end is significant in choosing a target.

#### Possible targets
- **`targets.BROWSER`** Stream will be played in a browser with CORS
- **`targets.NATIVE`** Stream will be played natively
